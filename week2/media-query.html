                <p>
                    To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, 
                    to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, 
                    the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; 
                    that they might be called trees of righteousness, 
                    the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.

                <p>
                    And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart 
                    and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart 
                    and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the 
                    Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at 
                    the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the 
                    Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.
